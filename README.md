<div align="center">

<h3> In 2022, I discovered my passion for coding and set out on a mission to become a full-time frontend developer. Along the way, I found joy in designing websites and developed a strong interest in UI/UX design. Iâ€™m eager for a career that offers intellectual stimulation, fosters personal growth, and embraces changeâ€”whether as a software engineer or a designer, Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities ahead! </h3>
