🔭 I’m currently working on an **itinerary builder app**.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Nextjs**.

👯 I’m looking forward to the **Feb-April [Collab Lab program](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)**.

💬 Ask me about how **many existential crises I have had since dreaming big to be a coder**.

⚡ Fun fact: I have three brothers, a mentor named Michael and a cat named Misty.

💍 Engaged to a Southern gentleman. 

⭐ Whats the latest? I applied for a job at Natural Cycles 🤞
